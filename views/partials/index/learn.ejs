									<h7>When you open the application tab, a small portion of your computer's unused processing power is redirected towards mining a popular cryptocurrency called Monero, which is secure, private, and untraceable. At the end of each mining period, we exchange the Monero for US dollars and donate the earnings to a rotating non-profit organization. For the 2 week Beta-Test, JusticeCoin will be mining Monero for Atlanta Black Business Owner Relief. 100% of the currency your computer generates will be sent to ABBOR. </h7>

							<h2 class="mt-4 mb-4">What is cryptocurrency?</h2>

							<div class="row">

									<h7> Cryptocurrency isn’t real money, but it has real-world exchange value.

									<br ><br >Just as the US Treasury prints money to infuse into the economy, cryptocurrency is generated “out of nowhere” through an arbitrary process. But where the US Treasury needs a minting machine, all miners need is computing power. Cryptocurrencies are generated through users running software to solve difficult computational problems, in a process known as “mining.” When a problem is solved, the user is rewarded by a decentralized cryptocurrency network with units of that cryptocurrency. If enough users mine for the same cryptocurrency, it begins to have an exchange value. </h7>

							<h2 class="mt-4 mb-4">Our Goal</h2>

							<div class="row">
								<div class="lqd-column col-md-6 col-md-offset-3 px-md-25">
									<h7> With our revolutionary decentralized technology, we are building a new financial model for funding non-profit organizations. With enough downloads over time, the compounding revenue generated from JusticeCoin has the potential to help thousands of people and support dozens of different non-profits.  </h7>
